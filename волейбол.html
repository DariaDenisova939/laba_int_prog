          <p><span>During my school volleyball life, I received many awards, participated in all competitions between schools. Volleyball has taught me resilience, endurance and discipline. Even taking into account professional injuries, volleyball is not included in the rating of the most traumatic sports in any way. With regular exercise, it hardens the body, strengthens the immune system, improves the circulatory system and the work of the cardiovascular and respiratory systems. Volleyball has a very positive effect on the nervous system: during the game it works at the limit — it is necessary to monitor the fast-moving players, perform their role, make decisions. In volleyball, you need to be very attentive and react very quickly, both physically and mentally. In professional matches, the speed of the ball can reach 130 kilometers per hour! Volleyball is a team game. In the classic version, the team consists of 6 people. Each of them has its own zones and specific tasks, but success always depends on everyone! A well-received ball, a clear pass to the attacker — and now the opponent is grieving because he didn't even have time to block the ball. The game of volleyball brings you closer, breaks the boundaries: it doesn't matter on the field whether you are a boss or a subordinate, insults and misunderstandings are forgotten, you are united by one task — and this is the main thing! Add to this a sense of social responsibility, hard work, courage and discipline - volleyball not only teaches, it educates</span></p>
